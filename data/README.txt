This folder contains the BigHand 2.2M dataset, which is organised as follows. Each subfolder (e.g. "Subject_1" or "Subject_7") contains the depth images for subjects 1 and 7. There are in total 12 subjects. Each subject subfolder is  divided in other 7 subfolders (e.g. "1 75", "301 375", "451 496"). These numbers indicate the viewpoints contained in each folder (read [1] for more details). Some subjects have an additional folder named "ego", which stands for egocentric viewpoint. Subject 12 has only one folder. 

"train_test_annotation" contains training and testing data split.

Unzip each folder before use and keep the same folder structure to match the annotations.
